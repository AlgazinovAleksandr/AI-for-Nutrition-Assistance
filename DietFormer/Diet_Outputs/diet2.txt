descibing_the_diet = "To improve blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, your diet should focus on balanced meals with nutrient-dense foods, managed carbohydrate intake, and consistent eating intervals. Your daily calorie target is approximately 1900-2200 kcal (moderately active BMI-adjusted estimate). Aim for a macronutrient breakdown: 40% carbs (focusing on complex sources), 30% protein, and 30% fats (primarily unsaturated).  
**Sample Day of Eating:**  
**Breakfast (8:00 AM):** 1 cup Greek yogurt + 1/2 cup mixed berries + 15g almonds (300 kcal, 30g carbs, 20g protein, 15g fat)  
**Mid-Morning Snack (10:30 AM):** Carrot sticks with 1 tbsp almond butter (150 kcal, 6g carbs, 4g protein, 12g fat)  
**Lunch (1:30 PM):** 100g grilled chicken breast + 1 cup quinoa + steamed broccoli (400 kcal, 40g carbs, 40g protein, 10g fat)  
**Dinner (6:30 PM):** Baked salmon (150g) + roasted sweet potatoes (150g) + green salad with olive oil (500 kcal, 60g carbs, 50g protein, 20g fat)  
**Evening Snack (Optional, if needed):** 1 small square dark chocolate (85% cacao) + a handful of walnuts (150 kcal, 8g carbs, 3g protein, 12g fat)  
**Timing:** Maintain 4-5 meal intervals (3 main meals + 1-2 snacks) with no extended fasts to stabilize blood sugar. Prioritize protein with each meal to enhance satiety and regulate glucose. Adjust portion sizes based on individual appetite and activity. Enjoy dark chocolate (85% cacao+) in moderation for your cravings."
